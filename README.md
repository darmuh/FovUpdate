# FovUpdate

### This is a simple mod that allows you to customize the game's field of view from the default value of 70. Also provides support for UltraWide or UltraLong screens (if enabled)

This is a client sided mod and only the person who is adjusting their fov will need it.  

- For basic instructions on how to use this mod, please follow the wiki article [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/darmuh/FovUpdate/wiki/3169-how-do-i-change-the-fov/)
- Set both your base-game field of view and your "crouched" / "tumble" field of view via the config.
- While in-game, you can also use the following chat commands:
	- ``\fov <number>`` input any number after ``\fov`` to immediately update your fov (and the config item)
	- ``\cfov <number>`` input any number after ``\cfov`` to immediately update your crouch fov (and the config item)
	- ``\sfov <number>`` input any number after ``\sfov`` to immediately update your sprinting fov modifier (and the config item)
	- FYI, everyone in the lobby **will** hear your chat commands
- Tested briefly in multiplayer, please report any issues to the github for this mod.
- As of 0.2.2, now provides ``AspectRatioFix`` config item for those with Ultrawide or Ultralong monitors.
	- This fix is originally from [Oksamies' UltrawideOrLongFix](https://thunderstore.io/c/repo/p/Oksamies/UltrawideOrLongFix/) and has been slightly modified.
	- As of 0.2.4, will ensure your camera updates to the correct aspect ratio (unstretched horizontally)
- As of 0.2.3, config change event support has been added for any mod that allows for config changes in-game (REPOConfig)
