# FovUpdate

### This is a simple mod that allows you to customize the game's field of view from the default value of 70.

This is a client sided mod and only the person who is adjusting their fov will need it.  

- Currently only adjusts your base-fov during the majority of normal gameplay.  
- When you crouch into a ball to hide, the game adjusts your gameplay camera's fov to something like 50.  
	- At some point I'll probably add an option to customize this as well.  
- Only tested in solo play, please report any issues to the github for this mod.
